** Thoughts 12/6 with Bhavani **
- On Hover, color coding with how many resources are available
    -- GREEN = LOTS
    -- YELLOW = SOME
    -- RED = MINIMAL
    - 3 types of resources (?) - local orgs, legal, etc.
    - Explain Map -- county (ON CLICK) get more resources/information based on desired type of resources wanted

- Richland County resources - build out the rest of the state as we get more info
    - Excel/SQL database with resources, move page over on-click to VIEW resources
